        <strong>◎ Hanwha Defense</strong>
        
        <p>Under the theme of “The Future of the Defense Industry and Challenges to the Global Market,” Hanwha Defense will focus on AI/autonomous combat vehicles and their ability to develop next-generation technologies for the future battlefield.</p>
        
        <p>Hanwha Defense is leading the development of defense robots that incorporate Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies such as artificial intelligence and plays a pioneering role in Korea’s “New Self-Reliant National Defense.” Since 2006, Hanwha Defense has carried out more than 15 national tasks related to unmanned systems and defense robots, and has the richest experience and proven technology in Korea.</p>
        
        <p>The first product that piques interest is the "intelligent multi-purpose unmanned vehicle”. Intelligent multi-purpose unmanned vehicles are expected to be a weapon system that will upgrade the combat efficiency of our army one step further. They, in place of human soldiers, can transport supplies, ammunition, and casualties, and can also provide firepower support with the weapons they are equipped with remotely. The multi-purpose unmanned vehicle is future unmanned system equipment that has not yet been deployed in the world, and is a 2-ton vehicle that is assigned to the infantry. It is a future defense robot system that can perform a variety of missions, such as △ surveillance and reconnaissance, △ communication relay, △ material transportation, △ wounded soldier transportation, and △ close combat, remotely or autonomously instead of soldiers in dangerous battlefield environments. In particular, the intelligent multi-purpose vehicle on a six-wheel drive platform newly developed by Hanwha Defense in July has the world's best performance, with major performance enhancements such as load weight and cruising range, and is expected to be equipped by our military as well as exported overseas in the future. The vehicle entered trial operations after signing a trial operation agreement with the 5th Infantry Division of the Army on the 28th last month.</p>
        
        <p>The hybrid electric propulsion system for tracked vehicles, which is touted as the next-generation power source, also seized the spotlight.</p>
        
        <p>The hybrid electric propulsion system for tracked vehicles is a next-generation power system that operates high-power motors with electric energy from batteries or hydrogen fuel cells to move tracked vehicles such as armored vehicles and tanks. Hanwha Defense will lead a project to develop key technologies for hybrid electric drive systems for tracked vehicles, including electromechanical transmissions (EMTs) starting from this year-end, and plans to complete it by 2025. The use of hybrid electric drive propulsion for tracked vehicles such as armored vehicles and tanks can not only improve mobility and fuel efficiency compared to existing internal combustion engine tracked vehicles, but also improve survivability through low-noise driving and gain many advantages during military operations. It is expected to make a significant contribution to the improvement of the future power of our military.</p>
